## Inspiration
Our project was inspired by our collective experiences in various workplaces, where we frequently encountered meetings that failed to meet our needs and expectations. We identified several issues, such as attending meetings that were not relevant to our positions or skills, scheduling conflicts that affected the participation of some attendees, and inadequate meeting spaces that did not cater to the technology or the complexity of the agenda. These challenges often led to frustration and a waste of valuable time. Therefore, we aimed to develop a program that could address these issues and optimize the efficiency of meetings.

## What it does
Our program streamlines the meeting process by first having all employees of the company register for the website, creating a personalized account, and providing crucial details such as their skills, position, and availability throughout the day. When an employee proposes a meeting, our program prompts them for essential information such as the agenda, preferred time, and required attendees. Our advanced AI model then analyzes this data and suggests the best employees to invite based on their skills and position, suggests a suitable meeting time that accommodates everyone's schedule, and even recommends the ideal location based on the size of the meeting and the necessary technology.

During the meeting, the designated meeting leader can efficiently check off tasks on the agenda, while taking detailed notes within our program. Alternatively, this responsibility can be assigned to any of the attendees prior to or at the start of the meeting. Once the meeting concludes, a copy of the notes, agenda, and list of attendees will be automatically sent to all participants, ensuring everyone stays on the same page.

Our program is the perfect solution for companies seeking to optimize their meeting efficiency, by minimizing wasted time and ensuring that each meeting is tailored to the specific needs and requirements of every attendee.

## How we built it
We build the web application using a combination of the Laravel and Vue frameworks. We used Laravel for the backend and Vue.JS for the front end. We also used TailwindCSS and their UI library TailwindUI to help speed up the UI development. For the AI part of this application, we used the OpenAI API.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take great pride in the accomplishments of our program, which boasts a modern and sleek user interface that maximizes user engagement and satisfaction. One of our most significant breakthroughs is the implementation of our "Should this be a meeting?" button, a deceptively simple yet incredibly powerful tool that enables users to eliminate unnecessary meetings before they even begin, saving valuable time and resources.

We are also particularly proud of our design choices, which prioritize user convenience and accessibility, minimizing roadblocks and optimizing the user experience. Our program leverages the latest advances in artificial intelligence, effectively harnessing its power to optimize scheduling and suggest ideal attendees, ensuring that every meeting is efficiently tailored to the specific needs and requirements of each participant.

Overall, our program represents a significant step forward in meeting efficiency, offering a streamlined and intuitive platform that enhances collaboration and productivity, and eliminates the unnecessary complexities and frustrations that plague traditional meeting structures.

## What we learned
We learned quite a bit about the use of AI in software. Both of us ever worked with AI before so we spend quite a bit of time working on perfecting our queries for the OpenAI API.
